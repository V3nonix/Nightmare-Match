  **INSTRUCTIONS:**

  This is a memory match game, where the cards slightly resemble playing cards. The game includes twenty-four cards total divided into four rows of six cards. The goal of this game is to match the twelve matching pairs within the allotted time and without going over the maximum allowed guesses. Once the game is started by clicking the start button, the memorization phase will begin. All cards will be placed face-up and will stay that way for three seconds, after which, they will be set face-down. 
  
  After the memorization phase, comes the matching phase, where the player can click on any face-down card. Once such a card is clicked, it will be set face up, becoming the active card, and the player will have to select its match. If the player clicks on a card that does not match, both the active card and the newly selected card will remain face-up for 1.5 seconds before being set face-down. The player will be unable to choose other cards before the cards reset as a punishment for choosing incorrectly and the player will lose one of their remaining guesses. If the player chose correctly, both cards will remain face-up for the duration of the game.

  Upon winning the game, the player will receive their score and a button allowing the player to play again will appear. The score is calculated as the amount of remaining time in seconds multiplied by the number of remaining guesses. Upon losing the game, the restart button will appear, but given the score is zero, it will not be displayed.
